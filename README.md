## Use data to answer the question:

“Which are the most valued data science skills?” 


For this project, we will be using the following tools:

*Communication: Discord / Zoom / WhatsApp as needed
*Collaboration / Code Management: Github
*Codebase: R-code
*Report / Presentation: Microsoft Office products (Word / PowerPoint)

## Project overview

To find the most valuable data science skills we collected data from job postings websites like Indeed and LinkedIn. To accomplish this, we created a list of keywords found ???, each representing a data science skill. We then used python to build a scraping tool for each of these websites to collect all instances of where those words were found in job postings and counted them. The results are the data we need to answer the question “Which are the most valued data science skills?”.

We also found and added some other studies trying to answer the same question. This will allow us to compare and contrast our results to those results and to analyze the differences in a variety of ways. We hope to get a satisfactory answer to the original question.
